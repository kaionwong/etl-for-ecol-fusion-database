- [x] ingesting/backing up database table from oracle to fusion
- [x] manually check if the backup/import into fusion is accurate
- [] confirm with Kari if entered highway plotting information will/will not be updated in Oracle (as for sure it is updated in Analytics)
- [] add foreign key relationships between tables
- [] ingest/backup eCollision analytics
- [] ingest/backup mainframe data; with field name matching or remapping (to map the column name, format and constraints like analytics)
- [] run script to process oracle import to create "valid" cases; may have to revisit the valid definition by excluding those entered after year end (second monday of Feb?)
- [] further standardize the format of oracle import, if necessary (to map the column name, format and constraints like analytics)
- [] final merge into the fusion data
- [] host it securely online so other team member can access
